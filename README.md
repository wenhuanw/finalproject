Description

The targeted audiences for our project are the users who are interested in getting a visual understanding of where recent criminal incidents in Seattle. Our web application integrates crime reports with the map and creates an interactive map that is visually marked with crimes that are color coded according to their types. Doing so will allows users to get a better and a clearer understanding of the danger levels of each neighbourhood. Also, by creating checkboxes for sorting we made data more user friendly as it is now easier to section off crimes that they are not interested in, which would further not have been possible in a standard table. In addition, we shows list of crimes and allow users to search among the tables. And statistics data are presented from 2009 to present so that users are able to see number of crimes happens in each neighborhood and in total.
